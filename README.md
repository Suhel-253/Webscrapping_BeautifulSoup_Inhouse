# Webscrapping_BeautifulSoup_Inhouse
 Extract relevant job opportunities from a job search portal (e.g., Internshala, TimesJobs, Bigshyft) using web scraping techniques. The specific objective is to construct a Python script that leverages web scraping techniques to extract crucial job facts, including job title, firm name, location, and job description, from the search results page of a specified employment portal. This structured data may then be stored in a suitable format for future analysis, display, or integration into existing applications.
